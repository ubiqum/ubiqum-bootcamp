        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. 
          In a free society, transparency is government's obligation to share 
          information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold their 
          public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government 
          should be transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials 
          conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money must be readily 
          available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and 
          just governance.  Transparency promotes accountability and provides 
          information for citizens about what their Government is doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also believe that government should be participatory. Public 
          engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves the 
          quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, 
          and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed 
          knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged 
          in American government.
        </p>

        <p>
          TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can 
          readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify information 
          of greatest use to the public.
