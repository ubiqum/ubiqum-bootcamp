            <dd>Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using superior safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials. Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA Official.
            Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the best protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.
            National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two additional Safety Levels.</dd>

            <dl>It is highly recommended that all convertible vehicles be equipped with an aftermarket roll bar that meets or exceeds the standards set in the Time Trials Safety Standard Level 2 (see below). However, minimum safety standards requires the vehicle meets at least one of the following criteria and is not subject to any of the listed exceptions:</dl>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Convertible vehicles up to and including the 2005 model year</b> must have rollover protection meeting one of the following criteria:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>The vehicle is equipped with documented factory installed roll over protection. (Examples of manufacturer-documented roll over protection include hydroformed and reinforced a-pillars or windshield frame and factory installed roll bars and/or “pop-up” bars that are designated as roll over protection.)</li>
                <li>The vehicle is equipped with a commercially produced roll bar or roll cage which is described by the manufacturer to provide track-appropriate rollover protection. (E.g., “style” bars are not acceptable.)</li>
                <li>The vehicle is equipped with a roll bar that meets the Safety Level 2 standards for material and construction.</li>
              </ol>
              <li><b>Convertible vehicles of the 2006 model year or later</b> must have a roll bar that meets the Safety Level 2 standards for material and construction unless one of the following criteria is met.</li>

          <li><h3>SAFETY LEVEL 2</h3></li>
          <ol>
            <li>Overview</li>
            <dl>Safety Level 2 generally means a 4-point roll bar, 5-point racing harness, arm restraints or window net, and fire-retardant helmets and clothing.</dl>
            <dl>For Time Trials Nationals Events, vehicles running on DOT-approved tires with less than 200 treadwear or beyond Max Category Rules must meet Safety Level 2 Standards. Vehicles with modified or aftermarket fuel tanks and lines which run through the cockpit will need to meet Safety Level 2 Standards for driver clothing.</dl>
            <dl>All vehicles required to meet Safety Level 2 Standards must meet the Safety Level 1 Standards, plus the additions below.</dl>
            <li>Vehicle Equipment</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Roll Bars</li>
              <dl>These specifications apply to all vehicles (other than those issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19). Cars issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19 may continue to compete with their previously approved rollover structure or comply with the following specifications.</dl>
              <dl>A roll bar is defined as a main hoop and diagonal placed behind the driver and supplemented by two braces. The roll bar must be designed to withstand compression forces resulting from the weight of the car coming down on the roll structure, and to take fore-and-aft loads resulting from the car skidding along the ground on the roll structure. The basic purpose of the roll bar is to protect the driver in case the vehicle rolls over. Roll bars must meet the following criteria:</dl>
              <ol type="A">
                <li>One continuous length of tubing must be used for the hoop member with smooth continuous bends and no evidence of crimping or wall failure.</li>
                <li>The top of the roll bar must be above the top of the driver’s helmet when the driver is in normal driving position.</li>
                <li>The two (2) vertical members forming the sides of the hoop must be more than 15 inches apart (inside dimension), and it is desirable that it extend the full width of the cockpit.</li>
                <li>An inspection hole of at least 3/16 inch diameter to facilitate verification of wall thickness may be required. It must be drilled in a non-critical area of a roll bar member at least three inches from any weld or bend.</li>
                <li>All bolts and nuts shall be SAE Grade 5 or better, 5/16-inch minimum diameter.</li>
                <li>Braces and portions of the main hoop subject to contact by the driver’s or passenger’s helmet, as seated normally and restrained by seatbelt and harness, must be padded with a non-resilient material such as Ethafoam® or Ensolite® or other similar material with a minimum thickness of 1/2 inch. Padding meeting SFI spec 45.1 or FIA 8857-2001 is strongly recommended.</li>
                <li>The size of tubing to be used for the main hoop, braces and diagonals shall be determined on the basis of the weight of the car. The following minimum sizes are required and are based upon the weight of the car without the driver. Dimensions are nominal; 0.010-inch variation in wall thickness is allowed.</li>

                </table>
                <li>The roll bar hoop and all braces must be of seamless or DOM mild steel tubing (SAE 1010, 1020, 1025) or equivalent, or alloy steel tubing (SAE 4130). For cars logbooked before 1/1/16, existing ERW tubing is acceptable.</li>
                <li>All welding should be of the highest possible quality with full penetration. Craters should be filled to the cross section of the weld and undercut be no more than 0.01 inch deep.</li>
                <li>All roll bars must be braced in a manner to prevent movement in a fore-and-aft direction with the braces attached within the top third of the roll hoop. At a minimum, two (2) braces must be used, parallel to the sides of the car, and placed at the outer extremities of the roll bar hoop. Such braces should extend to the rear whenever possible. Diagonal lateral bracing must be installed to prevent lateral distortion of the hoop. In most cases, a lateral brace from the bottom corner of the hoop on the side to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is sufficient. Although installing the diagonal lateral brace in the main hoop is the strongest alternative (and hence most preferable), there may be instances where such an installation is not practical. In such situations, the installation of the diagonal brace running from the bottom of the fore/aft brace on one side to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is acceptable. In convertible vehicles with a production line beginning 1990 or later, such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design, also known as a “double diagonal” used between the rear supports is acceptable.</li>
                <li>Removable roll bars and braces must be very carefully designed and constructed to be at least as strong as a permanent installation. If one (1) tube fits inside another tube to facilitate removal, the removable portion must fit tightly and must bottom on the permanent mounting, and at least two (2) bolts must be used to secure each telescope section. The telescope section must be at least eight inches in length. One (1) bolt is required if one (1) end is welded to the main hoop.</li>
                <li>Roll bars and braces must be attached to the frame of the car wherever possible. Mounting plates may be used for this purpose where desired.</li>
                <li>In the case of cars with unitized or frameless construction, mounting plates may be used to secure the roll bar structure to the car floor. The important consideration is that the load be distributed over as large an area as possible. A backing plate of equal size and thickness must be used on the opposite side of the panel with the plates through-bolted together.</li>
                <li>Mounting plates bolted to the structure shall not be less than 0.1875 inch thick and the use of a back-up plate of equal size and thickness on the opposite side of the panel with the plates through-bolted together is recommended. A minimum of three (3) bolts per plate is required for bolted mounting plates.</li>
                <li>Mounting plates welded to the structure shall not be less than 0.080 inch thick. Whenever possible, the mounting plate should extend onto a vertical section of the structure, such as a door pillar.</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Seats</li>
              <dl>It is highly recommended that the driver’s seat be replaced with a one-piece, bucket-type race seat. If used, the one-piece, bucket-type race seat shall be securely mounted and provide fore/aft and lateral support.</dl>

          <li><h3>SAFETY LEVEL 3</h3></li>
          <ol>
            <li>Overview</li>
            <dl>It is intended that Safety Level 3 be similar to that of SCCA Road Racing. Vehicles of motorsports-specific construction are required to meet these specifications. For National Time Trial Events, vehicles prepared beyond Max Category Rules and competing on tires without DOT-Approval must meet Safety Level 3 Standards.</dl>
            <dl>All Safety Level 3 vehicles must meet the requirements of Safety Levels 1 and 2, plus the inclusion of a roll cage compliant with specifications listed here. A roll cage consists of the main hoop, front hoop, side protection, and braces as specified in these Rules.</dl>
            <dl>These specifications apply to all vehicles other than those issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19. Cars issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19 may continue to compete with their previously approved rollover structure or comply with the following specifications.</dl>
            <dl>Please see SCCA General Competition Rules section 9.4 for diagrams and illustrations.</dl>
            <li>Roll Cages</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Main Hoop</li>
              <dl>The main hoop (behind the driver) must be the full width of the cockpit for all cars. It must be one continuous length of tubing with smooth bends and no evidence of crimping or wall failure. The main hoop must maintain a single plane.</dl>
              <ol type="A">
                <li>On all closed cars, the main hoop must be as close as possible to the roof and “B” pillars.</li>
                <li>On open cars retaining the windshield frame, the main hoop must be full height for the entire width of the hoop. The top of the main hoop must be at least 2 inches above the driver’s helmet.</li>
                <li>Open cars without the windshield frame may use an asymmetric main hoop. The main hoop must be full width to the passenger side of the car. On the passenger side of the car, the hoop must be at least as high as the top of the rear corner of the door. The main hoop must be high enough that a straight line drawn from the top of the main hoop to the top of the front hoop would pass over the driver’s helmet and steering wheel when the driver is seated in the normal driving position. Additionally, the top of the main hoop must be at least 2 inches above the driver’s helmet.</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Main Hoop Bracing</li>
              <ol type="A">
                <li>Main hoops shall incorporate a diagonal brace. The brace shall either be in the plane of the main hoop or extend from the top of one rear brace to the bottom of the opposite rear brace. Automobiles with mid-mounted engines can have the lower mounting point attach to the frame of the automobile within 6 inches of the main hoop. In the case of braces in the plane of the main hoop, the brace must span at least 50% of the width of the main hoop, and at least 75% of the height of the main hoop. In convertible vehicles with a production line beginning 1990 or later, such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design, also known as a “double diagonal” used between the rear supports is acceptable.</li>
                <li>Cars must incorporate a main hoop horizontal brace at the approximate level of the driver’s shoulders but not lower than the shoulder belt mounting point as described. If a double-diagonal “X” brace is used in the plane of the main hoop, a half-width horizontal brace may be used behind the driver’s seat to mount the seat back and shoulder harness.</li>
                <li>Cars must have two (2) braces extending to the rear from the main hoop and attaching to the frame or chassis. Braces must be attached as near as possible to the top of the main hoop (not more than 6 inches below the top), and at an included angle of at least 30 degrees.</li>
                <li>Open cars must have two (2) braces extending forward from the main hoop and attaching to the front hoop, not more than 6 inches below the top of the front and main hoop. It is recommended that the front and rear braces attach to the main hoop as close as possible to each other.</li>
                <li>On cars where the rear window/bulkhead prohibits the installation of rear braces (e.g., Honda del Sol), the main hoop shall be attached to the body by plates welded to the cage and bolted to the stock shoulder harness mounting points. This installation design must incorporate a diagonal bar connecting the top of the main hoop to the lower front passenger side mounting point (Petty bar). Alternatively, the rear window may be removed and a clear, LEXAN™ replacement installed. The rear cage braces may pass through this replacement window and through the engine cover or bodywork to allow connection to the frame or unibody.</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Front Hoop</li>
              <ol type="A">
                <li>Roll cages may be of two designs, low front hoop or high front hoop. All closed-top cars and cars that retain the windshield frame must have a high front hoop design. Open cars may incorporate a high or low front hoop design. High front hoops are also referred to as side hoops.</li>
                <li>All open cars with a high front hoop and all tube frame closed cars must incorporate a horizontal front hoop brace at the approximate level of the dashboard. It is recommended production-chassis cars also have the front hoop brace.</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Side Protection</li>
              <ol type="A">
                <li>Side tubes connecting the front and main hoops across both door openings are strongly recommended. Tubes that are welded to any part of the same mounting plate are considered to be connected to one another.</li>
                <li>NASCAR-style side protection or one bar bisecting another to form an “X” is permitted. Door side tubes may extend into the front door.</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Roll Cage Attachment Points</li>
              <ol type="A">
                <li>Production-chassis cars: The roll cage must attach to the vehicle structure within the passenger compartment in a minimum of six (6) points as specified in these Rules.</li>
                <li>Tube-frame cars: The roll cage shall be integrated into the frame or chassis.</li>
