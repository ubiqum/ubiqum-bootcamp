            <h1><b>TIME TRIALS SAFETY RULES</b></h1>
            <div class="container_safety_subtext">We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</div>
            <p class="safety_text">Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against
                injury or death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly
                using
                superior
                safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials. Drivers are
                responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation under elevated
                acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet
                completed
                and available to present to an SCCA Official.
                <br><br>
                Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the
                best protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint systems,
                roll
                bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.
                <br><br>
                National Time Trials Events and some
                SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two
                additional Safety Levels.

                            be of
                            seamless or DOM mild steel
                            tubing (SAE 1010, 1020,
                            1025) or equivalent, or alloy steel tubing (SAE 4130). For cars logbooked before 1/1/16,
                            existing ERW tubing is acceptable.</li>
                        <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">All welding should be of the highest
                            possible quality with full
                            penetration. Craters should be filled to the cross section of the weld and undercut be no
                            more
                            than 0.01 inch deep.</li>
                        <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">All roll bars must be braced in a
                            manner to
                            prevent movement in a
                            fore-and-aft direction with the braces attached within the top third of the roll hoop. At a
                            minimum, two (2) braces must be used, parallel to the sides of the car, and placed at the
                            outer
                            extremities of the roll bar hoop. Such braces should extend to the rear whenever possible.
                            Diagonal lateral bracing must be installed to prevent lateral distortion of the hoop. In
                            most
                            cases, a lateral brace from the bottom corner of the hoop on the side to the top corner of
                            the
                            hoop on the other side is sufficient. Although installing the diagonal lateral brace in the
                            main
                            hoop is the strongest alternative (and hence most preferable), there may be instances where
                            such
                            an installation is not practical. In such situations, the installation of the diagonal brace
                            running from the bottom of the fore/aft brace on one side to the top corner of the hoop on
                            the
                            other side is acceptable. In convertible vehicles with a production line beginning 1990 or
                            later, such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design, also known as a “double diagonal” used between
                            the
                            rear supports is acceptable.</li>
                        <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Removable roll bars and braces must be
                            very
                            carefully designed and
                            constructed to be at least as strong as a permanent installation. If one (1) tube fits
                            inside
                            another tube to facilitate removal, the removable portion must fit tightly and must bottom
                            on
                            the permanent mounting, and at least two (2) bolts must be used to secure each telescope
                            section. The telescope section must be at least eight inches in length. One (1) bolt is
                            required
                            if one (1) end is welded to the main hoop.</li>

                            the frame of the car wherever
                            possible. Mounting plates may be used for this purpose where desired.</li>
                        <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">In the case of cars with unitized or
                            frameless construction, mounting
                            plates may be used to secure the roll bar structure to the car floor. The important
                            consideration is that the load be distributed over as large an area as possible. A backing
                            plate
                            of equal size and thickness must be used on the opposite side of the panel with the plates
                            through-bolted together.</li>
                        <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Mounting plates bolted to the structure

                            inch thick and the use of a back-up plate of equal size and thickness on the opposite side
                            of
                            the panel with the plates through-bolted together is recommended. A minimum of three (3)
                            bolts
                            per plate is required for bolted mounting plates.</li>

                            shall not be less than 0.080 inch

                    specifications. For National Time Trial Events, vehicles prepared beyond Max Category Rules and
                    competing on tires without DOT-Approval must meet Safety Level 3 Standards.
                    <br><br>
                    All Safety Level 3 vehicles must meet the requirements of Safety Levels 1 and 2, plus the inclusion
                    of a
                    roll cage compliant with specifications listed here. A roll cage consists of the main hoop, front
                    hoop,
                    side protection, and braces as specified in these Rules.
                    <br><br>
                    These specifications apply to all vehicles other than those issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19.
                    Cars
                    issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19 may continue to compete with their previously approved rollover
                    structure or comply with the following specifications.
