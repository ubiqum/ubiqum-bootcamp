        <h2>TIME TRIALS SAFETY RULES</h2>
        <p>We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</p>

        <p> Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or death to
            participants, spectators or others.
            You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using superior safety gear, paying attention, and reporting
            unsatisfactory issues to the event officials.
            Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation under
            elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces.
            Drivers must have a Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA
            Official.</p>
        <p> Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the best protection
            that current technology can provide.
            It is recommended that seats, restraint systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards
            possible. </p>
