    <p><br> </p>
    <p class="rules-header-text ">We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p> Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or death to
        participants, spectators or others.
        You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using superior safety gear, paying attention, and reporting
        unsatisfactory issues to the event officials.
        Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation under
        elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces.
        Drivers must have a Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA
        Official.</p>
    <p><br> </p>
    <p> Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the best protection
        that current technology can provide.
        It is recommended that seats, restraint systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards
        possible. </p>
    <p><br> </p>

    <p>National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety required by these
        Rules. In these cases, there are two additional Safety Levels. </p>

                            following specifications.<br>A roll bar is defined as a main hoop and diagonal placed behind
                            the driver and supplemented by two braces. The roll bar must be designed to
                            withstand compression forces resulting from the weight of the car coming down on the roll
                            structure, and to take fore-and-aft loads resulting from the car
                            skidding along the ground on the roll structure. The basic purpose of the roll bar is to
                            protect the driver in case the vehicle rolls over. Roll bars must
                            meet the following criteria:</li>

                        <li class="to_skip_the_numeration">

                                <li>The top of the roll bar must be above the top of the driver’s helmet when the driver
                                    is in normal driving position.</li>
                                <li>The two (2) vertical members forming the sides of the hoop must be more than 15
                                    inches apart (inside dimension), and it is desirable that it extend the full width
                                    of the
                                    cockpit.

                                    thickness may be required. It must be drilled in a non-critical area of a roll bar
                                    member at least three inches from any weld or bend. </li>
                                <li>All bolts and nuts shall be SAE Grade 5 or better, 5/16-inch minimum diameter. </li>
                                <li>Braces and portions of the main hoop subject to contact by the driver’s or

                                    must be padded with a non-resilient material such as Ethafoam® or Ensolite® or other
                                    similar material with a minimum thickness of 1/2 inch.
                                    Padding meeting SFI spec 45.1 or FIA 8857-2001 is strongly recommended. </li>

                                    determined on the basis of the weight of the car. The following minimum sizes are
                                    required
                                    and are based upon the weight of the car without the driver. Dimensions are nominal;
                                    0.010-inch variation in wall thickness is allowed.<br>

                                <li>The roll bar hoop and all braces must be of seamless or DOM mild steel tubing (SAE
                                    1010, 1020, 1025) or equivalent, or alloy steel tubing (SAE 4130).
                                    For cars logbooked before 1/1/16, existing ERW tubing is acceptable. </li>
                                <li>All welding should be of the highest possible quality with full penetration. Craters
                                    should be filled to the cross section of the weld and undercut be no more than 0.01
                                    inch
                                    deep.
                                </li>
                                <li>All roll bars must be braced in a manner to prevent movement in a fore-and-aft
                                    direction with the braces attached within the top third of the roll hoop.
                                    At a minimum, two (2) braces must be used, parallel to the sides of the car, and
                                    placed at the outer extremities of the roll bar hoop. Such braces should
                                    extend to the rear whenever possible. Diagonal lateral bracing must be installed to
                                    prevent lateral distortion of the hoop. In most cases, a lateral brace from the
                                    bottom corner of the hoop on the side to the top corner of the hoop on the other
                                    side is sufficient. Although installing the diagonal lateral brace in the main hoop
                                    is the strongest alternative (and hence most preferable), there may be instances
                                    where such an installation is not practical. In such situations, the installation of
                                    the diagonal brace running from the bottom of the fore/aft brace on one side to the
                                    top corner of the hoop on the other side is acceptable. In convertible vehicles with
                                    a
                                    production line beginning 1990 or later, such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design, also
                                    known as a “double diagonal” used between the rear supports is acceptable. </li>
                                <li>Removable roll bars and braces must be very carefully designed and constructed to be
                                    at least as strong as a permanent installation.
                                    If one (1) tube fits inside another tube to facilitate removal, the removable
                                    portion must fit tightly and must bottom on the permanent
                                    mounting, and at least two (2) bolts must be used to secure each telescope section.
                                    The telescope section must be at least eight inches
                                    in length. One (1) bolt is required if one (1) end is welded to the main hoop. </li>
                                <li>Roll bars and braces must be attached to the frame of the car wherever possible.
                                    Mounting plates may be used for this purpose where desired. </li>
                                <li>In the case of cars with unitized or frameless construction, mounting plates may be
                                    used to secure the roll bar structure to the car floor.
                                    The important consideration is that the load be distributed over as large an area as
                                    possible. A backing plate of equal size and thickness
                                    must be used on the opposite side of the panel with the plates through-bolted
                                    together.
                                </li>
                                <li>Mounting plates bolted to the structure shall not be less than 0.1875 inch thick and
                                    the use of a back-up plate of equal size and thickness
                                    on the opposite side of the panel with the plates through-bolted together is
                                    recommended. A minimum of three (3) bolts per plate is required for bolted mounting
                                    plates. </li>
                                <li>Mounting plates welded to the structure shall not be less than 0.080 inch thick.
                                    Whenever possible, the mounting plate should extend onto a vertical section of the
                                    structure, such as a door pillar. </li>

                <li>Overview<br>It is intended that Safety Level 3 be similar to that of SCCA Road Racing. Vehicles of
                    motorsports-specific construction are required to
                    meet these specifications. For National Time Trial Events, vehicles prepared beyond Max Category
                    Rules and competing on tires without DOT-Approval must meet Safety Level 3 Standards.<br>All Safety
                    Level 3 vehicles must meet the
                    requirements of Safety Levels 1 and 2, plus the inclusion of a roll cage compliant with
                    specifications listed here. A roll cage consists of the main hoop, front hoop, side protection, and
                    braces as specified in these Rules.<br>These specifications apply to all vehicles other than those
                    issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19. Cars issued an SCCA Logbook before
                    1/1/19 may continue to compete with their previously approved rollover structure or comply with the
                    following specifications.<br>Please see <a href="https://www.scca.com/pages/cars-and-rules"

                        <li>Main Hoop<br>The main hoop (behind the driver) must be the full width of the cockpit for all
                            cars. It must be one continuous length of tubing with smooth bends and no evidence of

                                    the entire width of the hoop. The top of the main hoop must be at least 2 inches
                                    above the
                                    driver’s helmet.</li>

                                    opposite rear brace.
                                    Automobiles with mid-mounted engines can have the lower mounting point attach to the
                                    frame of the automobile
                                    within 6 inches of the main hoop. In the case of braces in the plane of the main
                                    hoop, the brace must span at least
                                    50% of the width of the main hoop, and at least 75% of the height of the main hoop.

                                    between the rear supports is acceptable.</li>
                                <li>Cars must incorporate a main hoop horizontal brace at the approximate level of the
                                    driver’s shoulders but not lower than the shoulder belt mounting point as described.
                                    If a double-diagonal “X” brace is used in
                                    the plane of the main hoop, a half-width horizontal brace may be used behind the
                                    driver’s seat to mount the seat back and
                                    shoulder harness.</li>
                                <li>Cars must have two (2) braces extending to the rear from the main hoop and attaching
                                    to the frame or chassis. Braces must be attached as near as possible to the top of
                                    the main hoop
                                    (not more than 6 inches below the top), and at an included angle of at least 30
                                    degrees.</li>
                                <li>Open cars must have two (2) braces extending forward from the main hoop and
                                    attaching to the front hoop, not more than 6 inches below the top of the front and
                                    main hoop.
                                    It is recommended that the front and rear braces attach to the main hoop as close as
                                    possible to each other.</li>
                                <li>On cars where the rear window/bulkhead prohibits the installation of rear braces
                                    (e.g., Honda del Sol), the main hoop shall be attached to the body by plates welded
                                    to the cage and bolted to the stock

                                    no crater porosity, no cracks, no whiskers, and so forth. Welds shall be continuous
                                    around the entire tubular structure. Procedures for
                                    welding alloy steel shall be in accordance with accepted industry practice. It is
                                    recommended that a certified AWS D1.1 welder do all welding.</li>
